# Spreadsheet examples

These directories contain spreadsheet-based examples of cinema databases.

There are two directories. All edits should be made to scripts, etc. in the ``generate`` directory. The data is then moved (via scripts) to the ``cinema_example_spreadsheet`` directory.

- ``generate`` - contains scripts used to generate examples, and install them in the directory below
- ``cinema_example_spreadsheet`` - contains databases generated by scripts in the above directory
